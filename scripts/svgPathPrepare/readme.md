Function that sets all the paths dash-array and dash-offset properties to the length of that path. Usually used for the animation of that path

Use: put the [data-svgAnimate] attribute inside the svgs that you want the function to work on.

Eg: <svg class="your-class" data-svgAnimate>...</svg>

Then just call svgPathPrepare() in your js file;
